# IPGTaskManager
- School Tasks Management developed in C#, HTML, CSS

- The main ideia of the present project is too create a path of communication between teachers and school assistants throught a "paging" system. 

- The power of this tool is to accelerate the needs of the teachers with the intuite of increasing classes productivity.
 
- Good examples of tasks can be when something is missing on a classroom, teachers may "page" any school assistants. Teachers have access to "available" school assistants on that moment and create the massage theyÂ´ll transmit to the assistants.

- Good ideia to attach this tool on a school system. Besides that, it could be possible to create a statistic system to check who makes more tasks, or who rejects more tasks.  

- Developed as Final Project of Web Programing Subject.
